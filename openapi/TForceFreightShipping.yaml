            When TForce Freight introduces new elements 
            in the response that are not associated with new 
            request elements, version is used. This ensures 
            backward compatibility.
            To get such elements you need to have the right 
            version. The value of the version is explained in 
            the Response element Description.
            Example: Itemized Charges are returned only 
            when the version element is present and greater 
            than or equal to 'v1601'. 
            Format: YYMM = Year and month of the release.
